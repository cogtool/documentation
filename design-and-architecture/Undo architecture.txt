To work with UNDO, each edit which can be undone/redone needs to create an UndoableEdit.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/undo/UndoableEdit.html
Since this is an interface we would use AbstractUndoableEdit which is an abstract class with much of the functionality already defined.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/undo/AbstractUndoableEdit.html


For classes which create EDITS use this method. Its part of the document model. The idea is to send an UndoableEditEvent to the listner.  
addUndoableEditListener(UndoableEditListener)

an UndoableEditEvent is a wrapper around an UndoableEdit and the object that called it. (usually this)

We use the undo manager to have a mechanism for walking forward and backwards through undo/redos.
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/undo/UndoManager.html

We can specify "key" undos, as well as undo events which can not be undone.. or that are sufficiently destructive, that previous undos can not be undone.

How to use the java undo pattern: Excellent resource & sample code for non trivial TXT example.

To provide more information to the user about what the UNDO step undoes, we will  need to subclass UndoManager.. or role it in a wrapper class. (see javaworld artical)
