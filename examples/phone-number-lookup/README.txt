Telephone Number Look-Up Task
Submitted by BonnieJohn-admin on 6 May 2009 - 10:58pm

This example compares two interfaces (a dialog box and a pop-up menu) on two tasks (look up one telephone number and look up two telephone numbers). The interfaces were first described by Nielsen and Phillips at CHI 1993 (N&P93) and have been modeled by using several types of KLM modeling frameworks. The original KLM was used in N&P93 and in John 1994; ACT-Simple was used by Salvucci and Lee a few years later, and it was the first demonstration of CogTool at CHI 2004.

This example demonstrates the use of menus, buttons, text boxes, highlighting text, Look-At steps, and context menus.

It's predictions for the dialog box tasks match observed data to within 10%. Its predictions for the pop-up (context) menu interface are not quite as good, probably because these are extremely short tasks, on the order of 2-4 seconds for today's users (4-6 seconds for N&P's users in the early 1990s when mice and context menus were less familiar), which leave little room for the approximation of thinking time inherent in the KLM model that underlies CogTool's predictions. Still, the models predict, correctly, that the dialog box interface will take 4-5 times as long as the pop-up menu interface.
