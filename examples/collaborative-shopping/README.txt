Collaborative Shopping
Submitted by BonnieJohn-admin on 23 April 2009 - 1:30pm

In the context of roommates shopping for a couch, this example compares three ways for people to share a link on craigslist, and a comment about the item. It compares GMail, Google Notebook, and a wiki set up with Wetpaint. Ironically, the analysis shows Google Notebook taking half the time of the other two applications, but Google decided to stop the project in Jan 2009. If only we had shared this analysis with them before their decision!

If you want to do this exercise yourself, use the TaskInstructions.doc file and the folders of images. If you wan to see how we did the comparison, download and unzip the CogTool file (.cgt) and look at our explanation in the AnswerKey.doc file.
