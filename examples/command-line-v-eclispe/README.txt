Comparison of typical command line and Eclipse-based programming tools.

Results of modelling four programming tasks.
We used CogTool to compare times for a number of tasks done using the programming environment commonly used for parallel code development in 2002 – Unix command line and Vim editor – with the same tasks done using the latest parallel tool support built into the Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform (PTP).  The tasks – creating a new program from a template, finding documentation on an API, folding (hiding) sections of code to ease understanding, and finding barrier mismatches causing a deadlock – were chosen because they are representative of common parallel programming tasks that the designers of PTP aimed to make easier.
