For doing CogTool's computations in ACT-R we run CLisp in a separate
process. An appropriate CLisp executable must be chosen, different for
 Intel Macintoshes or Windows machines. When we
start CLisp we also supply a memory image that CLisp loads,
initializing its heap quickly. These memory image files are also
specific to each of the two possible platforms.

The memory image contains the standard CLisp code, plus ACT-R,
including EMMA. It does not contain any of our additions, which we
just load at runtime. Thus the memory image need only be regenerated
whenever we upgrade to a new revision of ACT-R. But when we do so
upgrade, we must regenerate the memory image twice, once on each
platform, and be sure to check in the new memory images.

To generate a memory image simply run lisp/build-image.sh. On Windows,
this will need to be run in a Cygwin shell. 

In the past we rang this script twice, so that any Lisp compiler
detritus is not included in the checked-in version. However, this is
no longer necessary, as the script has been upgraded to essentially do
it twice itself. In the past we also had to generate a third image,
for PowerPC Macintoshes, but we have now dropped support for PowerPC.

So the overall process is

1) Upgrade ACT-R, and check in the new version.

2) Perform (a)-(c) twice once on an Intel Mac, and once on a Windows
machine:

a) Check-out an up to date copy of the trunk, including what was
checked in in (1).

b) run build-image.sh

c) Check-in the changes it has created.
