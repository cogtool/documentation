At the root of the source tree lives a file "copyright.txt" that
contains the boilerplate for the copyright notice we insert into every
source file.

In the "tools" directory in the trunk lives a script,
"update-comments", that will replace the existing copyright notice in
every one of our source files with the boilerplate. The easiest way to
run it is to cd into the root of the source tree
(e.g. /My/Home/Directory/trunk) and type "tools/update-comments".

Right now update-comments only knows about Java source files. However
it is table driven using regular expressions, and can easily be taught
other comment conventions as necessary.

Right now it updates all the source files in the java and mac-support
directories, not in subdirectories beginning with a dot
(e.g. ".svn"). If further locations need updating it can easily be
modified to do so.

In addition, there is a copyright in res/cogtool.nsi that needs to be
updated by hand.
