Human CSV Format documentation

For the command "Import" > "Import human data in .csv file ..."
accessed from the context-menu on a cell in the Project view.

In CSV format:
 1. comma-separated "cells"
 2. Double-quoted cells are allowed;
    to include a double-quote in a cell, double the double-quote to quote it!

It is expected that the first line is a row specifying column headers, with any
subset of the following values in any order (arbitrary upper/lower case is
accepted):
   - resource
   - description
   - target
   - start
   - end
   - duration
   - xpos
   - ypos
   - frame

where the values in each column should be:
   - "resource" is a string denoting an arbitrary trace visualization resource
   - "description" is a string specifying the operation performed
     (without the target; the target will be appended by the parser)
   - "target" is a string denoting the operation's target widget or device
   - "start" is the start time (format described below)
   - "end" is the end time (format described below)
   - "duration" is the operation's duration (format described below)
   - "xpos" is a double; the x-coordinate of the operation (currently ignored)
   - "ypos" is a double; the y-coordinate of the operation (currently ignored)
   - "frame" is a string specifying the frame containing the target
     (currently ignored)

where the time format is in MacShapa duration (each may be a real number):
    - ss
    - mm:ss
    - hh:mm:ss
    - hh:mm:ss:ff, where ff are frames (60 per second)

At a minimum, the "resource" and "start" columns must be present,
as well as one of "end" or "duration"; if both "end" and "duration" columns
are present, the "duration" column is used.

Both the "resource" and "start" columns must be specified and non-empty
for a result step to be generated for a CSV line.
Empty "resource" lines are ignored.
